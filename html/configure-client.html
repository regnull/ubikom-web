        <h1>Configure Your Email Client</h1>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        <p>After you finish the web setup, you must have the following information (below is an example, your details will 
            obviously be different):
            <img src="identitydetails.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Let's go over the information on this page. You need your private key (5 and 6) to keep the ultimate control
            over your identity. Although you don't need it to set up your email client, you might need it in future
            if you want to make any changes to your configuration, for example, change your POP3/SMTP credentials, 
            redirect email to a different server, etc. Save your key file in a secure location (item 5). Write down
            your key recovery phrase (item 6) and keep it in a secure, offline location. If your key file is ever lost,
            you may use your key recovery phrase to restore your private key.
        </p>
        <p>To set up your email client, we will use the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>Your identifier (1)</li>
                <li>Your SMTP/POP3 user name and password (2 and 3)</li>
                <li>SMPT and POP3 server (4)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Below, we will show how to set up some popular email clients, step by step</p>
        <h2>Mozilla Thunderbird</h2>
        <h3>Download and Install Mozilla Thunderbird</h3>
        <p>If you haven't done it already, download Mozilla Thunderbird <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">here.</a></p>
        <h3>Set Up New Email Account</h3>
        <p>When you first open Thunderbird, it will invite you to add a new account.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="thunderbird-set-up-email-address.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
           Put your name in "Your name" box. Thunderbird doesn't care what it is, but the other users will see this name when
            they receive an email from you.
        </p>
        <p>
            In "Email address" box, put your identifier (1) from your identity details page, and add "@x". Our identifier was testuser321,
            so we entered testuser321@x. Some clients might not accept this as a valid email. To make them happy, you can also use
            "@ubikom.cc", for example, testuser321@ubikom.cc
        </p>
        <p>
            In "Password" box, put your password from the identity details page (3).
        </p>
        <p>
            Click "Configure manually..." to proceed to the next step.
        </p>
        <h3>Configure Server Settings</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="thunderbird-server-settings.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            In this dialog, you need to set up server settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under INCOMING, enter the following:
            <ul>
                <li>"POP3" for protocol</li>
                <li>"alpha.ubikom.cc" for server (item 4 from identity details)</li>
                <li>"995" for port (the default)</li>
                <li>"SSL/TLS" for SSL</li>
                <li>"Normal password" for authentication</li>
                <li>User name is the one from idenity details (2)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Under OUTGOING, enter the following:
            <ul>
                <li>"alpha.ubikom.cc" for server (item 4 from identity details)</li>
                <li>"465" for port (the default)</li>
                <li>"SSL/TLS" for SSL</li>
                <li>"Normal password" for authentication</li>
                <li>User name is the one from idenity details (2)</li>
                <li>Click "Done".</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Send a message to yourself (testuser321@x in this example) to make sure everything works. You will be prompted for your password, 
            enter the password you used when getting your identity (item 3 on the identity details page).
        </p>
        <h2>iOS Mail</h2>
        <p>Go to Settings, Mail, Accounts. Tap "Add Account"</p>
        <p>
            <img src="ios-mail-add-account-1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Tap "Other".</p>
        <p>
            <img src="ios-mail-add-account-2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Tap "Add Mail Account"</p>
        <p>
            <img src="ios-mail-add-account-3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In "Name" box, enter your name as you want it to appear to other users. iOS Mail does not care what it is.</p>
        <p>In "Email" box, enter your identifier (item 1 in identity details page) and append "@ubikom.cc". So, if 
            your identifier is testuser321, your email will be testuser321@ubikom.cc.
        </p>
        <p>In "Password" box, enter your password from the identity details page (3).</p>
        <p>You can enter anything in the "Description" box to help you identify the account. Here, we name the 
            account "Ubikom".
        </p>
        <p>Tap "Next". You will see the following screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="ios-mail-add-account-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Choose POP instead of IMAP.</p>
        <p>In both "INCOMING MAIL SERVER" and "OUTGOING MAIL SERVER" sections, enter the following:
            <ul>
                <li>For "Host Name", use Server URL item from the identity details page (4)</li>
                <li>For "User Name", use the User name item from the identity details page (2)</li>
                <li>For "Password", use Password from the identity details page (3)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Tap "Save". It might sit there for a while testing the server connection, but eventually it will succeed.
            If you get an error back, double-check your values and try again.
        </p>
        <h2>Caution: Sending Email to External Recipients</h2>
        <p>
            When you send email to another Ubikom user, your message is encrypted with a unique key
            so only the recipient can decrypt it. Sometimes you might want to send email to users
            outside the Ubikom ecosystem. Currently we provide a gateway to the legacy email world.
            When you send email through the gateway, it will be decrypted and sent as a regular old
            email. Be careful when you send email to the external addresses. In future we will add a warning,
            but for now you need to pay attention.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Be Even More Secure</h2>
        <p>
            With the simplest configuration, public email proxy handles encryption and decryption for you.
            One of the key ideas we have is that user must be able to strike the right balance between
            security and convenience. Because Ubikom is an open-source project, you can run any part of
            it (and really the whole thing, if you want) yourself. Probably the first part you might want to
            consider running is the email proxy. If you run it yourself, your encryption key never leaves
            your possession. See the code at <a href="https://github.com/regnull/ubikom">GitHub repo</a>,
            where you can also download the binaries (or build them from source yourself).
