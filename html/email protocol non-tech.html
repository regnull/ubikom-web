<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>Any messaging platform must uniquely identify senders and recipients and guarantee faithful delivery.
    We can break this task into three parts:
<ul>
    <li>Guarantee name uniqueness</li>
    <li>Guarantee message delivery to the correct recipient</li>
    <li>Guarantee that the message was not tampered with in transit</li>
</ul>
One possibility is for a central authority to assign globally unique names to users and manage delivery between
them. The problem with this approach is that everything is dependent on the existence and goodwill of a central
authority. Since power corrupts, centralization leads to abuse of trust and bad service from corporations, and
trampling of rights, censorship, and oppression from governments.
</p>

<p>
    A better way to create a public encryption utility is to have a unique cryptographic key pair assigned to
    each user. Every sent message will be signed by the private key and verified using the public key. The problem
    of the user identification is reduced to the control of the private key.
</p>

<p>
    If you are signing all the outgoing messages with your private key, you might as well encrypt them with a unique key
    derived from your private key and the recipient's public key. This way, only the recipient can decrypt the message.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, addressing users by their public keys works well for machines but not for humans. We prefer short names
    that
    are easy to remember, so we might want to create a registry to keep such names and the corresponding keys. But we
    must make sure that such a registry does not become the central authority that we seek to avoid.
</p>
<p>
    These ideas led to the creation of Ubikom, the registry of digital avatars.
    The diagrams below explain Ubikom‘s protocol for sending and receiving emails, which are end-to-end encrypted by
    design.

<h4> Alice and Bob met at a party and exchanged avatars/ubikoms.</h4>

<h4> The next day, Alice contacts Bob. Her email app sends Bob’s ubikom (avatar name)
    to the avatar registry and receives Bob’s public key.</h4>

<h4> Alice encrypts the message with this key and sends it to a storage server.</h4>

<p> As you can see, only encrypted messages are ever sent via public network. </p>
