<h2>Avatar registry has moved to blockchain</h2>
<p>
    At the very beginning, Ubikom avatars were registered in a database on a server. However,
    the whole idea of Ubikom is to step away from having an owner, any kind of owner, including us, the founders.
    It was clear that we had to move the registry to a decentralized platform that no one can control. Because if
    anyone could claim control over it, Ubikom would be no different from any other centralized email. In due time,
    inevitably,
    it would succumb to political or corporate pressure and start betraying its users (Anyone remembers "don't be evil"?
    Google it! Ha-ha-ha).
</p>
    So, now we have it. The registry is run on a custom blockchain inspired by Ethereum. Why do we need a custom blockchain?
    We struggled with this question a lot and researched different blockchains. The decision boils down to this:
    for Ubikom, blockchain is a means, not the end. Email has to remain ubiquitous and cheap. All current blockchains
    suffer from the high price and volatility of the tokens. Some may say that this is feature, not a bug of a token-based
    economics. This might be true for creating alternative money, but it is preventing blockchains to underpin affordable
services. </p>
<p>At the same time, we want Ubikom validators to be well rewarded for their work. This is the dynamic tension inherent
    in the design. We believe that the problem will be resolved through the volume of transactions: the multitude of
    cheap simple transactions will keep the work to support it profitable. The exact nature of prevention of
    speculative schemes based on ubiks (Ubikom's tokens) is being worked out.
