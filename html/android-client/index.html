        <h1>Android Client Setup</h1>
        <p>
            Unlike iOS, Android does not have an email app (apart from GMail) 
            packaged with the system. You will have to install one of the following
            clients to be able to use Ubikom Mail.
        </p>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        This is the information presented on your identity details page:
        <p><img src="../client-common/identity-details.png"/></p>
        <p>
        Important things to notice are:
        <ul>
            <li>The identifier. Your email address will be your identifier plus "@ubikom.cc".
                I.e. if your identifier is "spongebob", your email address will be "spongebob@ubikom.cc".
            </li>
            <li>
                You password. You chose it, you should know what it is. If you don't, click "Show" button
                to reveal it. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        That's all you need if you use a client supporting automatic configuration (see below). You can also
        use pretty much any client, even if they can't configure your email automatically. In this case, you
        will also need the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Your user name. It's normally the same as your identifier.</li>
            <li>
                Server URL. This is the URL you will use for SMTP and IMAP servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bluemail.mail">Blue Mail</a></h2>
        <p>
            We recommend Blue Mail because it's a great email client, it works on any platform (mobile and
            desktop), and it configures automatically using your email and password 
            (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bluemail.mail">download</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Open the app. You will be asked to set up new account.

        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, enter account name ("Ubikom Mail" will do), and your name as you want it to appear to message
            recipients. Tap "Done".
        </p>
        <h3>Problems?</h3>
        <p>If your setup doesn't work, double-check your settings. You might want to
            delete this account completely and try to set it up again.
