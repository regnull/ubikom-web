        <h1>Android Client Setup</h1>
        <p>
            Unlike iOS, Android does not have an email app (apart from GMail) 
            packaged with the system. You will have to install one of the following
            clients to be able to use Ubikom Mail.
        </p>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        This is the information presented on your identity details page:
        <p><img src="../client-common/identity-details.png"/></p>
        You need to notice a few things here:
        <ul>
            <li>The identifier. Your email address will be your identifier plus "@ubikom.cc".
                I.e. if your identifier is "bob", your email address will be "bob@ubikom.cc".
            </li>
            <li>
                User name, same as your identifier. You will need it to set up connection
                to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Password. It will be required (together with user name) to set up
                connection to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Server URL. This is the URL you will use for SMTP and IMAP servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Blue Mail</h2>
        <p>
            Blue Mail is our personal favorite, and it works on iOS, Android, Mac OS X and Windows.
        </p>
        <h3>Download Blue Mail</h3>
        <p>
            You can download Blue Mail from Google Play store 
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bluemail.mail">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Add New Account</h3>
        <p>
            When you first open Blue Mail, tap on "Add account". On the next screen,  tap "Other Email".
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter your email address (which will be your identifier with "@ubikom.cc" added, i.e. "bob@ubikom.cc"). 
            Enter your password. Uncheck "Automatic" box. Tap "Next".
        </p>
        <p>
            On the next screen, tap "IMAP" button.
        </p>
        <h2>Configure Your Account</h2>
        <p>
            At this point, you will have "Email Address", "Username", and "Password" boxes already populated.
            <ul>
                <li>In "IMAP server" box, enter "alpha.ubikom.cc".</li>
                <li>For "Security", choose "SSL/TLS".</li>
                <li>For "Authentication", "PLAIN" should be chosen.</li>
                <li>Port must be 993.</li>
            </ul>
            Tap "Next".
        </p>
        <p>
            On the next screen, you will need to configure outgoing server settings.
            <ul>
                <li>For SMTP server, enter "alpha.ubikom.cc"</li>
                <li>For "Security", choose "SSL/TLS".</li>
                <li>Leave "Port" as 465.</li>
                <li>Make sure "Require sign-in" box is checked.</li>
                <li>Choose "PLAIN" for "Authentication".</li>
                <li>"Username" is your username from the identity details page (your email will also work).</li>
                <li>"Password" is your password. It will probably be already populated.</li>
            </ul>
            Tap "Next".
        </p>
        <p>
            On the next screen, enter your name as it will appear to email recipients, and the description, for
            example, "Ubikom Mail". Tap "Done".
        </p>
        <p>
            On the next screen, leave "Push or Fetch" as "Push". Tap "Done".
        </p>
        <h3>Problems?</h3>
        <p>If your setup doesn't work, double-check your settings. You might want to
            delete this account completely and try to set it up again.
