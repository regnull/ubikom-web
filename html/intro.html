        <h1>Let's Reinvent Email</h1>
        <p><a href="mailto:lgx@ubikom.cc">lgx@ubikom.cc</a></p>

        <p>Why is it so hard to send secure private messages?</p>

        <p>You might say, it’s not hard at all - there are many options:  
          Gmail, WhatsApp, Twitter, Slack, Discord, just to name a few. But thos are
	  provided by big commersial companies - what about just private messages between 
          individuals? Why does Bob need Google to send a message to Alice?
          Why can't I just run a simple piece of software, and be able to send messages
          to anyone, privately, securely, and without intermediaries?</p>
        
        <p>Of course, there is email. If you want to use it without intermediaries, 
          you theoretically can. It’s not easy, but you can get a domain, set up your machine, 
          configure your message transfer agent, add necessary DNS records, set up spam filtering, 
          and you are good to go. Then, you also need to constantly monitor your system to make 
          sure it’s properly configured, latest patches are applied, it's not forwarding spam, etc.
	  This is not a viable 
          option for most users.</p>
        
        <p>This is the reality we have to live with, and we don’t normally question it. 
          However, some time ago, I asked myself a question - what if secure private 
          messaging were simple, free, and ubiquitous? How would you do it?
	  For a while, I was trying to find answers as a mental exercise.</p>
        
        <p>Soon, I've realized that it comes down to the question of identity. 
          Ever since email was invented, user identities were attached to a domain, or a server. 
          It made sense - only large organizations could afford to run an email system. 
          You must have some physical hardware. And, having your address attached to a domain, 
          conveyed the sense that you are acting on behalf of this organization.</p>
        
        <p>The limitations of this approach became more clear as more users adopted email. Switching 
          domains became painful - and this had to happen when a user switched ISPs, for example. 
          Accessing email from anywhere was anything but simple. The solution for all these 
          troubles was web mail, made popular by Hotmail and RocketMail in the 1990s.</p>
        
        <p>Although web mail made life easier, it brought with it a whole different set of problems. 
          Now you don’t really own your email, it is being provided to you by a corporation, 
          which, at the end of the day, must make money somehow. You are not the one paying for 
          the service - or rather, you pay by sharing your personal information for ad targeting. 
          Not only that, they can disable your account at any time with no 
          explanation, effectively cancelling a large part of your online identity.</p>
        
        <p>There has to be another way. What would 
          happen if we were to re-design the way we communicate, knowing everything that we 
          know now?</p>

        <p>We start by asserting that a person’s identity must be owned by that person, and not 
          any third party (concept known as 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>). 
          But what is “identity” and how can someone own it? You may define 
          identity in any number of ways, but if you try to reduce it to something essential, 
          you would probably end up with something like independent existence. When you receive 
          data from an entity (human or otherwise), the least you can ask is an assurance that 
          any data claiming to be from the same source indeed came from the same source. 
          This can be easily done by using Private Key Infrastructure (PKI) and by signing any data 
          you send out. Using PKI, you also encrypt data with a key derived 
          from the recipient’s public key, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it.</p>
        
        <p>So far so good. Here’s an interesting side effect - if you are encrypting all the 
          outgoing data, it becomes less important how exactly it is delivered  to the recipient. 
          This is very important for delivering regular, un-encrypted, email. 
          Just look at any of leaked email scandals. But, if your email is encrypted, 
          you don’t care if it is intercepted - no one will be able to read it, except you. 
          For all we care, we can have a single email dump, where you can just go to receive 
          your email. Apart from it, everything else is just a bunch of meaningless bytes.</p>
        
        <p>Next, we want some easy way to address your messages. Sure, we can use the receiver’s 
          public key, or an address derived from it - but it’s not easy to give someone over 
          the phone. You can’t beat small, pronounceable names. If we want to associate names 
          with public keys, we have to have some sort of a registry.</p>
        
        <p>This, but itself, is a big challenge. The registry must be universally accessible and 
          not controlled by a single authority. Blockchain is an obvious choice, but it also carries 
          a number of downsides:</p>
        
            <ul>
            <li>Currently, blockchains are closely associated with digital currencies. You would have to 
            pay for the registry operations, which would seriously limit adoption.</li>
        
            <li>Bitcoin-style blockchain requires a massive amount of compute to generate blocks, 
            which delays the transaction verification.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>This is why I ended up designing my own solution, which uses something similar 
          to a proof of stake for transaction verification. The identity registry is decentralized, 
          and anyone can run a network node. There is a limited number of signing tokens circulating 
          around the network. To get a token, you must be a member in good standing (as verified 
          by the nodes currently holding tokens). To become one, you need to start with the last 
          good snapshot of the identity database, accept incoming transactions, verify them, 
          apply to the database, and generate new snapshots from time to time. If a snapshot 
          generated by you happens to match snapshots generated by the current token holders 
          (which is communicated using zero knowledge proof algorithm), you improve your 
          standing among all network nodes.</p>
        
        <p>There are many other issues to address, and I refer you to the 
          <a href="/tech-description.html">technical overview</a> if 
          you want more detail. The end result is a working email system based on self-sovereign 
          identity, which you can use right now. Still work in progress, but it is functional -
