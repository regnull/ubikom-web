<h1>
    Let's reinvent email!
</h1>
<p>
    Email is a convenient, cheap, and powerful way of communication. It is one of the first successful applications of
    the
    nascent, late 20th century internet. It is ubiquitous and unassuming. Why improve it?
</p>

<p>
    Email was invented in a different era. Its first users were scientists who liked working in broad collaboration.
    They
    appreciated email’s ability to connect them to colleagues around the world. This was before the advent of spam,
    phishing, targeted ads, snooping, and other problem children of the internet. Email was not designed to be secure,
    or
    particularly private. Its creators did not anticipate that email would become the most ubiquitous form of
    communication,
    thus inviting spying, censorship, abuse, theft, and other attendant human ills.
</p>

<p>
    Now, more than 30 years since its use became widespread, email is neither safe, nor private, nor belongs to its
    users -
    sending confidential messages is difficult; it is owned by giant corporations, which are reading emails to send us
    ads and can block or close our accounts; data privacy is not protected (companies owning email services not only
    are snooping on us, but they can respond to a government’s requests to share their users’ data); it is so easy for
    oppressive government to read email traffic, that no dissident would think about using email.
</p>

<p>
    Most of us do not give much thought to these concerns, until we must face consequences of our lesser-fair attitude.
    My Outlook account was blocked because calendar went crazy. For a few days my main personal account was
    inaccessible.
    And everyone has an identity theft story to share, especially if you have ageing parents who are targeted by
    scumbags.
</p>

<p>
    Can we make email truly confidential and secure, while keeping its convenience and low cost?
    (Even though most of us don’t pay for email, we are paying indirectly by letting companies glean valuable data from
    our “private” communications.)

</p>

<p>
    The problem of confidentiality of communication has been solved by the invention of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public key
        cryptography</a>.
    If we want to receive a confidential message, the sender needs to obtain our <i public key></i>, which a long string
    of
    numbers. The public key locks the protective envelope of the sent message. We own—and keep safely on our personal
    device—the corresponding <i private key></i> that unlocks the envelope. It is computationally unfeasible for anyone
    to open
    the envelope without the private key. This technology underlies internet security.
</p>

<p>
    However, it is difficult to keep the protocol convenient and robust. Solutions such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S/MIME</a> rely on
    centralized
    certificate authorities and are
    <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.7869&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank"
       rel="noopener noreferrer">very hard to configure and use</a>.
    The standard centralized
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public
        key infrastructure</a>
    (PKI) required for this protocol is unwieldy.
</p>

<h2>Enter Ubikom</h2>

<p>
    We make it easy to create and register names with the corresponding cryptographic keys. These names are freely
    chosen
    by users and are <b avatars></b>, rather than real IDs. The avatars belong to us, the users who created them, rather
    than to giant
    corporations dominating our digital lives. Since avatars are recorded on a public blockchain, they are freely
    accessible by anyone. Protected by blockchain technology, avatars are safe from bans or deletions: no one can cancel
    or ban us from our accounts, since no one owns access to them.
</p>

<p>
    Here’s an interesting side effect—if you are encrypting all the outgoing data, it becomes less important how exactly
    your message is delivered to the recipient. Safe delivery channels are very important for regular, un-encrypted,
    email (recall any of the leaked email scandals). But if your email is encrypted, you don’t care if it is
    intercepted—no one will be able to read it anyway. For everyone but you, your email is just a bunch of meaningless
    bytes.
</p>

<p>
    Ubikom users can exchange emails with accounts outside of Ubikom, of course. However, since emails in legacy systems
    are not encrypted, we must decrypt emails when they leave the Ubikom’s perimeter. The more people join Ubikom, the
    more secure is everyone's email.
</p>

<p>
    Ubikom avatars are registered on a blockchain. Today, blockchains are firmly associated with digital currencies.
    For us, however, registration on the blockchain must remain cheap for the service to remain affordable or free for
    personal use. For this and other reasons we are creating own blockchain for the ID registry. Early participants will
    receive <b ubiks></b>, the tokens of this blockchain.
</p>
<!--        <p>Why is it so hard to send secure private messages?</p>

        <p>You might say, it’s not hard at all - there are many options:  
          Gmail, WhatsApp, Twitter, Slack, Discord, just to name a few. But thos are
	  provided by big commersial companies - what about just private messages between 
          individuals? Why does Bob need Google to send a message to Alice?
          Why can't I just run a simple piece of software, and be able to send messages
          to anyone, privately, securely, and without intermediaries?</p>
        
        <p>Of course, there is email. If you want to use it without intermediaries, 
          you theoretically can. It’s not easy, but you can get a domain, set up your machine, 
          configure your message transfer agent, add necessary DNS records, set up spam filtering, 
          and you are good to go. Then, you also need to constantly monitor your system to make 
          sure it’s properly configured, latest patches are applied, it's not forwarding spam, etc.
	  This is not a viable 
          option for most users.</p>
        
        <p>This is the reality we have to live with, and we don’t normally question it. 
          However, some time ago, I asked myself a question - what if secure private 
          messaging were simple, free, and ubiquitous? How would you do it?
	  For a while, I was trying to find answers as a mental exercise.</p>
        
        <p>Soon, I've realized that it comes down to the question of identity. 
          Ever since email was invented, user identities were attached to a domain, or a server. 
          It made sense - only large organizations could afford to run an email system. 
          You must have some physical hardware. And, having your address attached to a domain, 
          conveyed the sense that you are acting on behalf of this organization.</p>
        
        <p>The limitations of this approach became more clear as more users adopted email. Switching 
          domains became painful - and this had to happen when a user switched ISPs, for example. 
          Accessing email from anywhere was anything but simple. The solution for all these 
          troubles was web mail, made popular by Hotmail and RocketMail in the 1990s.</p>
        
        <p>Although web mail made life easier, it brought with it a whole different set of problems. 
          Now you don’t really own your email, it is being provided to you by a corporation, 
          which, at the end of the day, must make money somehow. You are not the one paying for 
          the service - or rather, you pay by sharing your personal information for ad targeting. 
          Not only that, they can disable your account at any time with no 
          explanation, effectively cancelling a large part of your online identity.</p>
        
        <p>There has to be another way. What would 
          happen if we were to re-design the way we communicate, knowing everything that we 
          know now?</p>

        <p>We start by asserting that a person’s identity must be owned by that person, and not 
          any third party (concept known as 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>). 
          But what is “identity” and how can someone own it? You may define 
          identity in any number of ways, but if you try to reduce it to something essential, 
          you would probably end up with something like independent existence. When you receive 
          data from an entity (human or otherwise), the least you can ask is an assurance that 
          any data claiming to be from the same source indeed came from the same source. 
          This can be easily done by using Private Key Infrastructure (PKI) and by signing any data 
          you send out. Using PKI, you also encrypt data with a key derived 
          from the recipient’s public key, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it.</p>
        
        <p>So far so good. Here’s an interesting side effect - if you are encrypting all the 
          outgoing data, it becomes less important how exactly it is delivered  to the recipient. 
          This is very important for delivering regular, un-encrypted, email. 
          Just look at any of leaked email scandals. But, if your email is encrypted, 
          you don’t care if it is intercepted - no one will be able to read it, except you. 
          For all we care, we can have a single email dump, where you can just go to receive 
          your email. Apart from it, everything else is just a bunch of meaningless bytes.</p>
        
        <p>Next, we want some easy way to address your messages. Sure, we can use the receiver’s 
          public key, or an address derived from it - but it’s not easy to give someone over 
          the phone. You can’t beat small, pronounceable names. If we want to associate names 
          with public keys, we have to have some sort of a registry.</p>
        
        <p>This, but itself, is a big challenge. The registry must be universally accessible and 
          not controlled by a single authority. Blockchain is an obvious choice, but it also carries 
          a number of downsides:</p>
        
            <ul>
            <li>Currently, blockchains are closely associated with digital currencies. You would have to 
            pay for the registry operations, which would seriously limit adoption.</li>
        
            <li>Bitcoin-style blockchain requires a massive amount of compute to generate blocks, 
            which delays the transaction verification.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This is why I ended up designing my own solution, which uses something similar 
          to a proof of stake for transaction verification. The identity registry is decentralized, 
          and anyone can run a network node. There is a limited number of signing tokens circulating 
          around the network. To get a token, you must be a member in good standing (as verified 
          by the nodes currently holding tokens). To become one, you need to start with the last 
          good snapshot of the identity database, accept incoming transactions, verify them, 
          apply to the database, and generate new snapshots from time to time. If a snapshot 
          generated by you happens to match snapshots generated by the current token holders 
          (which is communicated using zero knowledge proof algorithm), you improve your 
          standing among all network nodes.</p>
            -->

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Any messaging platform must uniquely identify senders and recipients and guarantee faithful delivery.
    We can break this task into three parts:
<ul>
    <li>Guarantee name uniqueness</li>
    <li>Guarantee message delivery to the correct recipient</li>
    <li>Guarantee that the message was not tampered with in transit</li>
</ul>
One possibility is for a central authority to assign globally unique names to users and manage delivery between
them. The problem with this approach is that everything is dependent on the existence and goodwill of a central
authority. Since power corrupts, centralization leads to abuse of trust and bad service from corporations, and
trampling of rights, censorship, and oppression from governments.
</p>

<p>
    A better way to create a public encryption utility is to have a unique cryptographic key pair assigned to
    each user. Every sent message will be signed by the private key and verified using the public key. The problem
    of the user identification is reduced to the control of the private key.
</p>

<p>
    If you are signing all the outgoing messages with your private key, you might as well encrypt them with a unique key
    derived from your private key and the recipient's public key. This way, only the recipient can decrypt the message.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, addressing users by their public keys works well for machines but not for humans. We prefer short names
    that
    are easy to remember, so we might want to create a registry to keep such names and the corresponding keys. But we
    must make sure that such a registry does not become the central authority that we seek to avoid.
</p>
<p>
    These ideas led to the creation of Ubikom, the registry of digital avatars.
    The diagrams below explain Ubikom‘s protocol for sending and receiving emails, which are end-to-end encrypted by
    design.
</p>

<h4> Alice and Bob met at a party and exchanged avatars/ubikoms.</h4>
<img src="diag/email diag 1.png" width="670" height="200"/>

<h4> The next day, Alice contacts Bob. Her email app sends Bob’s ubikom (avatar name)
    to the avatar registry and receives Bob’s public key.</h4>
<img src="diag/email diag 2.png" width="670" height="150"/>

<h4> Alice encrypts the message with this key and sends it to a storage server.</h4>

<p> As you can see, only encrypted messages are ever sent via public network. </p>
