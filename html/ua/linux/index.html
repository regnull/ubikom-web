        <h1>Linux Client Configuration</h1>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        <p>From the identity details page, you must have at least the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Your email</li>
                <li>Your password</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If your client does not support automatic configuration, you will also need these:
            <ul>
                <li>Outgoing server address and port</li>
                <li>Incoming server address and port</li>
                <li>User name (same as your identifier, email will also work)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a></h2>
        <p>Thunderbird is one of the best email clients supporting all major desktop platforms, including Linux.
            It's easy to configure Thunderbird - all you need to do is enter your email and password.
            You can download Thunderbird <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">here</a>. Many
            distributions come with Thunderbird pre-installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you open Thunderbird, you will be asked to set up an account (or you can do
            it at any time by selecting <b>File, New, Existing Mail Account</b> from the menu).
        </p>
        <p><img src="../mac-os-x-client/os-x-thunderbird-1.png"/></p>
        <p><b>
            Enter your name (as it will appear to email recipients), email address and password. Click "Continue".
        </b></p>
        <br/>
        <p><img src="../mac-os-x-client/os-x-thunderbird-2.png"/></p>
        <p><b>
            The account will be configured automatically. Click "Done".
        </b></p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Any other client</h2>
        <p>You can use any email client that supports IMAP (or POP3) and SMTP, which
            is virtually all of them! Check out the instructions for setting up 
            a <a href="../generic-client/index.html">generic client</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Problems?</h2>
        <p>If your setup doesn't work, double-check your settings. You might want to
            delete this account completely and try to set it up again.
