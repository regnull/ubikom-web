        <h1>Android Client Setup</h1>
        <p>
            Unlike iOS, Android does not have an email app (apart from GMail) 
            packaged with the system. You will have to install one of the following
            clients to be able to use Ubikom Mail.
        </p>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        <p>From the identity details page, you must have at least the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Your email</li>
                <li>Your password</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If your client does not support automatic configuration, you will also need these:
            <ul>
                <li>Outgoing server address and port</li>
                <li>Incoming server address and port</li>
                <li>User name (same as your identifier, email will also work)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bluemail.mail">Blue Mail</a></h2>
        <p>
            We recommend Blue Mail because it's a great email client, it works on any platform (mobile and
            desktop), and it configures automatically using your email and password 
            (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bluemail.mail">download</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Open the app. You will be asked to set up new account.

        <p>K-9 is a bit old, but still excellent. It works well with Ubikom Mail and is easy to set up and use.
            You can download K-9 Mail <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9">here</a>.
            When you open the app, you will be prompted to create a new account.

        <h2>Any other client</h2>
        <p>You can use any email client that supports IMAP (or POP3) and SMTP, which
            is virtually all of them! Check out the instructions for setting up 
            a <a href="../generic-client/index.html">generic client</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Problems?</h2>
        <p>If your setup doesn't work, double-check your settings. You might want to
            delete this account completely and try to set it up again.
