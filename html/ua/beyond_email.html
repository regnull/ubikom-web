<h1>Ubikom: Beyond Email</h1>

<p>
    Ubikom is a digital ID registry, and its utility goes well beyond email. Let’s say that you want to sign up for
    a local yoga studio, or subscribe to a newspaper, or obtain an undeniable proof of ownership of goods or services.
    Normally, you would register a name and password with the seller and keep the log-in information for each such
    service. It is humanly impossible to remember all these logins, and we end up with either just a few log-in
    combinations, which is very unsafe, or purchase a password manager. When accounts are hacked and passwords leaked,
    which happens depressingly often, our log-in combinations are exposed, which gives criminals an entry point to
    steal our identity.
</p>

<p>
    Now imagine that you signed up with your ubikom avatar instead. No passwords need to be kept anywhere: thanks to
    public key cryptography, you and only you can authenticate yourself as the owner of this avatar and therefore the
    owner of the purchase. Even if the seller’s server is hacked, nothing of interest is leaked - your avatar is not
    a secret.
</p>

<p>
    Yet another application of the avatar registry is the Internet of Things. Your baby monitor, security camera,
    or smart thermostat must have safe and reliable online representation. Ubikom protocol removes the need for a
    hodgepodge of firmware and standardizes interaction with and between objects. This protects the IoT from being hacked
    through weak links, which may be present anywhere: lax security of your "smart" refrigerator's
    or vacuum cleaner's connectivity can allow thieves to take over your network, and compromise security of your house.
    Tested to a high standard safety protocols built on Ubikom's identity registry will provide universal robust security.
