        <h1>iOS Client Setup</h1>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        This is the information presented on your identity details page:
        <p><img src="../client-common/identity-details.png"/></p>
        You need to notice a few things here:
        <ul>
            <li>The identifier. Your email address will be your identifier plus "@ubikom.cc".
                I.e. if your identifier is "bob", your email address will be "bob@ubikom.cc".
            </li>
            <li>
                User name, same as your identifier. You will need it to set up connection
                to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Password. It will be required (together with user name) to set up
                connection to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Server URL. This is the URL you will use for SMTP and IMAP servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
