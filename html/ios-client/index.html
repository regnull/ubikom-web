        <h1>iOS Client Setup</h1>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        This is the information presented on your identity details page:
        <p><img src="../client-common/identity-details.png"/>
        Important things to notice are:
        <ul>
            <li>The identifier. Your email address will be your identifier plus "@ubikom.cc".
                I.e. if your identifier is "spongebob", your email address will be "spongebob@ubikom.cc".
            </li>
            <li>
                You password. You chose it, you should know what it is. If you don't, click "Show" button
                to reveal it. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        That's all you need if you use a client supporting automatic configuration (see below). You can also
        use pretty much any client, even if they can't configure your email automatically. In this case, you
        will also need the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Your user name. It's normally the same as your identifier.</li>
            <li>
                Server URL. This is the URL you will use for SMTP and IMAP servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><a href="">Blue Mail</a></h2>
        <p>
            We recommend Blue Mail because it's a great email client, it works on any platform (mobile and
            desktop), and it configures automatically using your email and password. Download Blue Mail for
            iOS <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-mail-email-mailbox/id1063729305">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>iOS Mail</h2>

            chances are, you have it installed.
