        <h1>Mac OS X Client Configuration</h1>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        <p>From the identity details page, you must have at least the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Your email</li>
                <li>Your password</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If your client does not support automatic configuration, you will also need these:
            <ul>
                <li>Outgoing server address and port</li>
                <li>Incoming server address and port</li>
                <li>User name (same as your identifier, email will also work)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Mail</h2>
        <p>Mail comes with Mac OS, and it's easy to configure and use.</p>
        <p>Open Mail, then go to <b>Mail, Add Account, Other Email Account.</b> menu.</p>

            <b>
                Make sure account type is "IMAP". Enter "imap.ubikom.cc" for incoming mail server, and
                "smtp.ubikom.cc" for outgoing mail server, click "Sign In". You can leave user name as "Automatic".
            </b>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            <b>
                On the next scree, select apps you want to use with this account - select "Mail", and optionally
                "Notes". Click "Done".
            </b>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Problems?</h2>
        <p>If your setup doesn't work, double-check your settings. You might want to
            delete this account completely and try to set it up again.
