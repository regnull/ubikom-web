        <h1>Windows Client Setup</h1>
        <p>
            Unlike iOS, Android does not have an email app (apart from GMail) 
            packaged with the system. You will have to install one of the following
            clients to be able to use Ubikom Mail.
        </p>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        This is the information presented on your identity details page:
        <p><img src="../client-common/identity-details.png"/></p>
        You need to notice a few things here:
        <ul>
            <li>The identifier. Your email address will be your identifier plus "@ubikom.cc".
                I.e. if your identifier is "bob", your email address will be "bob@ubikom.cc".
            </li>
            <li>
                User name, same as your identifier. You will need it to set up connection
                to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Password. It will be required (together with user name) to set up
                connection to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Server URL. This is the URL you will use for SMTP and IMAP servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Windows Mail</h2>
        <p>Windows Mail is included in Windows 10 and 11 (maybe older versions as well).</p>
        <h3>Add New Account</h3>
        <p>
            Open Windows Mail (you can search for Mail in the search bar). Once there, click on 
            the settings button in the bottom left corner of the window. Then, click "Manage Accounts",
            "Add account".
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list of account types, chose "Other account POP, IMAP".
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next screen, fill in the form as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>For "Email address", enter your identifier followed by "@ubikom.cc". For example,
                    if your identifier is "bob", you would enter "bob@ubikom.cc".
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Send your messages using this name", enter your name as you want it to 
                    appear to email recipient. It can be anything. Mail doesn't care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Password", enter the password from the identity details page (same password
                    you chose when creating your identity).
                </li>
            </ul>
            Click "Sign in". Mail will do it thing and fail. You will need to click "Try again" until
            it gives up and shows you "Internet email account" screen where you can specify details
            of your email service.
        </p>
        <h3>Configure Your Account</h3>
        <p>
            Now, you should see "Internet email account" screen where you can specify your
            account options.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For "User name", enter your user name from your identity details page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Password", enter your password (this field may be already populated).
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Account Name", enter the name for this account, for example, "Ubikom Mail".
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Send your messages using this name" field, enter your name as you want it
                    to appear to mail recipients. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Incoming email server", enter "alpha.ubikom.cc".
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Account Type", choose "IMAP4".
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Outgoing (SMTP) email server", enter "alpha.ubikom.cc".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure "Outgoing server requires authentication" box is checked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure "Use the same name and password for sending email" box is checked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Click "Sign in". On the next screen, click "Done".
