        <h1>Windows Client Setup</h1>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        <p>From the identity details page, you must have at least the following:

                <li>Your email</li>
                <li>Your password</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If your client does not support automatic configuration, you will also need these:
            <ul>
                <li>Outgoing server address and port</li>
                <li>Incoming server address and port</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a></h2>
        <p>Thunderbird is one of the best email clients supporting all major desktop platforms, including Linux.
            It's easy to configure Thunderbird - all you need to do is enter your email and password.
            You can download Thunderbird <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">here</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When you open Thunderbird, you will be asked to set up an account (or you can do
            it at any time by selecting <b>File, New, Existing Mail Account</b> from the menu).
        </p>
        <p><img src="../mac-os-x-client/os-x-thunderbird-1.png"/></p>
        <p><b>
            Enter your name (as it will appear to email recipients), email address and password. Click "Continue".
        </b></p>
        <br/>
        <p><img src="../mac-os-x-client/os-x-thunderbird-2.png"/></p>
        <p><b>
            The account will be configured automatically. Click "Done".
        </b></p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Windows Mail</h2>
        <p>Windows Mail is included in Windows 10 and 11 (maybe older versions as well).</p>
        <h3>Add New Account</h3>
        <p>
            Open Windows Mail (you can search for Mail in the search bar). Once there, click on 
            the settings button in the bottom left corner of the window. Then, click "Manage Accounts",
            "Add account".
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list of account types, chose "Other account POP, IMAP".
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next screen, fill in the form as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>For "Email address", enter your identifier followed by "@ubikom.cc". For example,
                    if your identifier is "bob", you would enter "bob@ubikom.cc".
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Send your messages using this name", enter your name as you want it to 
                    appear to email recipient. It can be anything. Mail doesn't care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For "Password", enter the password from the identity details page (same password
                    you chose when creating your identity).
                </li>
            </ul>
            Click "Sign in". Mail will do it thing and fail. You will need to click "Try again" until
            it gives up and shows you "Internet email account" screen where you can specify details
            of your email service.
        </p>
        <h3>Configure Your Account</h3>
        <p>
            Now, you should see "Internet email account" screen where you can specify your

                    For "Account Name", enter the name for this account, for example, "Ubikom Mail".
                </li>
                <li>
