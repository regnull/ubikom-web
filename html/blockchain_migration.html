        <h1>Ubikom Blockchain Migration</h1>
        <p>On <b>March 18th, 2023</b>, we will turn off the legacy authentication methods. Unless you've registered your name with 
            Ethereum Mainnet, you will lose your access to Ubikom.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Are We Doing This?</h2>
        <p>
            We started Ubikom with a vision of decentralized private identity and secure communications,
            where you are in control of both your identity and the encryption keys. While you’ve been enjoying secure
            communication, we are now ready to deliver another key part - decentralized identity registry.
            As of now, we are running  a mix of database-centered identity registry and private blockchain.
            Today, with crypto prices much lower than a year ago and Ethereum’s “merge” complete, we are
            ready to switch to Ethereum blockchain and accomplish the goal of delivering private
            decentralized identity to our users. 
        </p>
        <h2>What Do You Need To Do</h2>
        <p>
            If you do nothing, you will lose the access to Ubikom on March 28th, 2023. If you would like to continue using
            Ubikom, you would need to register your user name on Ethereum Mainnet.
        </p>
        <h2>Registering Identity on Ethereum Mainnet</h2>
        <h3>Install Metamask</h3>
        <p>You need to have Metamask Wallet installed in order to perform transactions on Ethereum Mainnet. Download it 
            <a href="https://metamask.io/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Fund your account</h3>
        <p>You can fund your account in many different ways. You can open an account on one of the popular cryptocurrency
            trading platforms, for example <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>. You can also search popular user 
            communities, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum">this one on Reddit</a> for ways to buy Ether. Lately,
            we are seeing some sites that let you buy Ether with a credit card instantly - we haven't used any of them, so
            use your own judgement.
        </p>
        <h3>Register your identity</h3>
        <p>Now that you have your wallet installed and account funded, you can register your identity on Ethereum Mainnet.
            Go to the <a href="https://www.ubikom.cc/register_name.html">name registration page</a>, and continue from there.
        </p>
        <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>Depending on the gas fees (see below) and Ether exchange rate, registering your identity may cost you $5 or higher.</p>
        <h3>How to save Ether</h3>
        <p>When you register your identity, you must pay 
          <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees/">gas fees</a>. The gas price is usually
          measured in GWei and it fluctuates wildly - it's not uncommon to see the gas price changes 10x in a course of
          one day. If you want to save some Ether, you need to conduct your transaction when the gas price is low.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can track the current gas price on many different sites - for example, 
            <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">here</a>. You can also install a 
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocknative-gas-fee-estim/ablbagjepecncofimgjmdpnhnfjiecfm">Chrome extension</a> that
            shows the gas price, and register your identity when the gas price is low. 
            As we are writing this, the price of 25 GWei or less is pretty 
            good, while the price of 50 GWei or more is quite high - you may want to wait for it to come down.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Verify your Registration</h2>
        <p>We have tools that help you to verify that your registration has succeeded, all of them are accessible
            from Ubikom <a href="https://ubikom.cc">main page</a>.
