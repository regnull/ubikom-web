<h1>
    Testing Ubikom on Ethereum Blockchain
</h1>
<p>
    Before we fully switch to Ethereum blockchain for identity registry, we will test 
    it on Sepolia testnet. This page describes what do you need to do to help with testing.
</p>
<h2>Install MetaMask Wallet</h2>
<p>You need to install MetaMask wallet as Chrome extension. Get it <a href="https://metamask.io/">here</a>. 
    After you install it, configure your account. Now you will need to enable test networks in MetaMask:
    Click on the network name (probably "Ethereum mainnet") in the top middle, and choose "show/hide test networks".
    You will be sent to the configuration page, where you would need to enable test networks.
</p>
<p>
    Once this is done, go back to the main window, click on "Ethereum mainnet" and select "Sepolia test network".
</p>
<h2>Get Your Account Funded</h2>
<p>
    Since this is a test network, the currency (SepoliaETH) has no real value. You can get it by going to one of
    Sepolia Faucets and requesting some ETH. Google for "Sepolia Faucet". Try a few of them. I had some luck with
    <a href="https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/">this one</a>, and <a href="https://sepolia-faucet.com/">this one.</a>
    By the time you read this, the situation may change and you might need to try another one.
</p>
<p>
    You don't need a lot of ETH - something like 0.2 would be enough.
</p>
<h2>Register a Name</h2>
<p>For now, please do not register your main name (the one you were using to send and receive emails on Ubikom).
    Because we used a different encryption algorithm in the past, your encryption keys might not match (even
    if you used the same password), which would result in your mailbox being deleted and re-created. It's safer
    to try with another, test name.
</p>
<p>Now that you have your wallet configured and funded, you can go ahead and register a name on
    Sepolia testnet. You can start from our <a href="https://www.ubikom.cc/">main page</a>, enter the name you 
    want to register and go from there. You will need to perform two transactions on the block chain - 
    the first one to register the name (and the associated encryption key, derived from your password), and the
    second one to register the endpoint, i.e. where your messages are getting delivered.
</p>
<p>
    Strictly speaking, you don't even need to do the second one - without the endpoint, you cannot receive 
    messages, but that's okay if you just want to own the name, and maybe use it in future.
</p>
<p>
    Notice that when transaction is successfully done, you can click on the transaction hash to see the
    details on Etherscan.
</p>
<h2>Verify That the Name is Registered</h2>
<p>You can verify your name registration <a href="https://www.ubikom.cc/name_reg.html">here.</a> Verify
    that the name was successfully registered.
</p>
<h2>Send and Receive Email</h2>
<p>You can use the newly registered name as before - either in the webmail, or in a standalone email
    client. Notice that you will only be able to receive email if you registered the endpoint, as a part of
    name registration.
</p>
<h2>Try Other Name Operations</h2>
<p>When you own a name, you can update the configuration information, sell it or transfer it to another owner:</p>
<p><a href="name_reg.html">Check name registration</a></p>
<p><a href="change_enckey.html">Change password (encryption key)</a></p>
<p><a href="change_endpoint.html">Update endpoint</a></p>
<p><a href="sell_name.html">Sell a name</a></p>
<p><a href="buy_name.html">Buy a name</a></p>
<p>Notice that when a price for a name is zero, it's not for sale. If you update price to anything greater than
zero, anyone will be able to pay the price and get ownership over the name. You will automatically get the proceeds
in the account that was used to register the name.
