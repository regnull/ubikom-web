        <h1>Ubikom 2.0</h1>

        <p>We started <a href="https://ubikom.cc">Ubikom</a> with a vision of decentralized private identity and secure communications, 
            where you are in control of both your identity and the encryption keys. While you’ve been enjoying secure 
            communication, we are now ready to deliver another key part - decentralized identity registry. 
            As of now, we are running  a mix of database-centered identity registry and private blockchain. 
            Today, with crypto prices much lower than a year ago and Ethereum’s “merge” complete, we are 
            ready to switch to Ethereum blockchain and accomplish the goal of delivering private 
            decentralized identity to our users. We are finalizing testing on the new Ethereum testnet, 
            <a href="https://sepolia.dev/">Sepolia</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We are inviting all our users to switch their registration to Ethereum blockchain. 
        This will require a small gas fee of about $1.5 to perform the name registration transactions 
        (and ONLY Ethereum gas fees - we are not charging anything for interaction with our smart contract). 
        You don’t waste your money - you receive something of value, which is your name registered on blockchain. 
        Later, you can transfer name ownership to another account, if you so desire, or sell it for Ether. 
        It’s like an NFT, but this one is actually useful. With the cost being so low, why not grab a few other names 
        (consider some popular words). Maybe they will be worth something in the future, who knows?
        </p>

        <p>
        So what to expect? Let’s go over some key milestones:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>We will continue testing on Sepolia testnet for at least a few more weeks (roughly until the end of January, 2023). 
            You can participate on <a href="https://ubikom.cc">our website (ubikom.cc)</a> where you can register your name on 
            Sepolia without paying real crypto (you pay SepoliaETH, which you can get for free).
        </li>
        <li>
        Once the testing is complete, we will switch to Ethereum mainnet. At this point, names registered on 
        the mainnet will have priority over the current identity registry. Which is to say, you need to act quickly 
        lest someone else chooses the same name (this is very unlikely, but you need to know). Rest assured, current 
        infrastructure will still work until the switch is complete, see below. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Finally, March 1st is the day when we will turn off the legacy infrastructure, and rely ONLY on the Ethereum mainnet. 
        Names that were not migrated by that time will stop functioning.
        </li>
        <li>
        Obviously, this is a work in progress and all dates may change.
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        If you do nothing, your service will terminate around March 1st. If you want to continue using Ubikom, here’s what you can do:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Follow the announcements on our Twitter page and Reddit. We will not email future updates to all users, unless absolutely necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
        If you would like to help with testing on Sepolia testnet, <a href="testing_eth.html">we have written the instructions.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
        Look out for the instructions on how to migrate your account to the mainnet, which should be sent out (via Twitter and Reddit) around February 1st.
        </li>
        <li>
        Migrate your account to the mainnet when the migration tools are available (sometime in February).
        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        This migration will complete the first stage of the service. But we are not going to stop there. Future enhancements will include 
        decentralized storage of the encrypted messages, supporting multiple internet gateways, instant messenger and other 
        services based on the decentralized user-owned identity.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thank you for being our loyal users. We hope you are as excited about the future as we are.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Q: How does the decentralized identity on the blockchain work?</h3>
        
        <p>
        A: An Ethereum <a href="https://github.com/regnull/ubchain/blob/master/contracts/v2/registry.sol">smart contract</a> maintains the 
        registry of names, public keys, and endpoints where messages should be delivered. This registry is used every time a message is sent, 
        to construct a shared encryption key and find out the address where the message will be delivered.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Q: Will I truly own the name after I register it on the Ethereum mainnet?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        A: Yes. Our smart contract is public (see <a href="https://github.com/regnull/ubchain/blob/master/contracts/v2/registry.sol">here</a>). 
        Once you register a name, it is associated with your address, and only you can perform operations on it (update the configuration, update 
        the public key, transfer it to another owner or sell it).
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Q: How expensive is it to register a name on the blockchain?
        </h3>

        <p>
        A: You pay only the gas fees (i.e. you pay to miners to include this transaction into the next block). Our experiments showed that the 
        one-time cost of adding your name to Ubikom’s smart contract on Ethereum can be  as little as $1.5. Again, this is not the fee charged 
        by Ubikom. If you are not in a rush, you can offer even less - but confirmation might take longer. Obviously, gas prices can and do 
        change, and we have no way to predict future prices.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Q: I understand that the cost is trivial, but this is still more than I can afford.
        </h3>

        <p>
        A: We are working on ways to get our loyal users migrated, even if they can’t afford the fees. Stay tuned.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Q: Isn’t crypto a scam?
        </h3>

        <p>
        A: Glad that you asked! No, only 95% of crypto is a scam. We believe the crypto foundations are solid, and this is one reason why we 
        decided to use Ethereum - it’s the network second only to Bitcoin (and we can’t use Bitcoin since we need smart contract support). We 
        also believe that the current crypto contraction is healthy in the long run - let’s get rid of hype and fraud, and keep building.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        Q: How do I get started with crypto?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        A: You need to do two things: get a crypto wallet (for example, <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>), and fund your account. 
        There are many ways to get the initial funds, which vary by country. Please consult your local user community. Beware: 
        crypto message boards and Discord servers are inundated by scammers. If someone is contacting you out of the blue, it’s a scam, no 
        matter what they say. Never share any passwords or recovery phrases with anyone. Consider using a hardware wallet - it’s more reliable 
        and secure than a software one.
