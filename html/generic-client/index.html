        <h1>Generic Client Setup</h1>
        <p>
            This page contains instructions on how to set up Ubikom Mail on a generic 
            client, i.e. any mail client that supports SMTP and IMAP protocols. Most clients do.
        </p>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        <p>From the identity details page, you must have at least the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Your email</li>
                <li>Your password</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If your client does not support automatic configuration, you will also need these:
            <ul>
                <li>Outgoing server address and port</li>
                <li>Incoming server address and port</li>
                <li>User name (same as your identifier, email will also work)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Create New IMAP Account</h2>
        <p>
            Most email clients support IMAP protocol. When you create a new account, 
            choose IMAP (sometimes you would have to choose "other", or "mail client", etc.)
        </p>
        <h2>Specify Account Details</h2>
        <p>
            You will have to fill in the account details. Most likely they will come in a few
            groups, general account information, incoming server (IMAP) details, and outgoing
            server (SMTP) details. Lets go over them.
        </p>
       <h3>General Account Information</h3>
       <p>
           Here, you would need to specify a few things:
            <ul>
                <li>Email address - this is your identifier with "@ubikom.cc" added to it.
                    If your identifier is "bob", your email address is "bob@ubikom.cc".
                </li>
                <li>Account name - this is just a name for your account. Something like 
                    "Ubikom Mail" would do.
                </li>
                <li>Password - the client may use this password for IMAP (and possibly SMTP) login.</li>
                <li>Account type - if you can chose between POP and IMAP, chose IMAP.</li>
            </ul>
       </p>
       <h3>Incoming Server Information</h3>
       <p>
           Here you specify information for your incoming (IMAP) server:
           <ul>
               <li>Server addres - enter "imap.ubikom.cc"</li>
               <li>Server port - 993, which is the default.</li>
               <li>User name - this is your user name from the identity details page.</li>
               <li>Password - your password.</li>
               <li>Security - chose SSL/TLS.</li>
               <li>Authentication - choose Plain, or Normal Password.</li>
           </ul>
       </p>
       <h3>Outgoing Server Information</h3>
       <p>
           This section is for outgoing (SMTP) server:
           <ul>
            <li>Server addres - enter "smtp.ubikom.cc"</li>
            <li>Server port - 465, which is the default.</li>
            <li>User name - this is your user name from the identity details page.</li>
            <li>Password - your password.</li>
            <li>Security - chose SSL/TLS.</li>
            <li>Authentication - choose Plain, or Normal Password.</li>
            <li>If you have a checkbox saying something like 
                "server requires authentication", make sure it's checked</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
       <h2>Problems?</h2>
       <p>If your setup doesn't work, double-check your settings. You might want to
           delete this account completely and try to set it up again. 
       </p>
