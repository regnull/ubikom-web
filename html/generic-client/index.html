        <h1>Generic Client Setup</h1>
        <p>
            This page contains instructions on how to set up Ubikom Mail on a generic 
            client, i.e. any mail client that supports SMTP and IMAP protocols. Most clients do.
        </p>
        <h2>Check Your Identity Details</h2>
        This is the information presented on your identity details page:
        <p><img src="../client-common/identity-details.png"/></p>
        You need to notice a few things here:
        <ul>
            <li>The identifier. Your email address will be your identifier plus "@ubikom.cc".
                I.e. if your identifier is "bob", your email address will be "bob@ubikom.cc".
            </li>
            <li>
                User name, same as your identifier. You will need it to set up connection
                to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Password. It will be required (together with user name) to set up
                connection to email servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Server URL. This is the URL you will use for SMTP and IMAP servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Create New IMAP Account</h2>
        <p>
            Most email clients support IMAP protocol. When you create a new account, 
            choose IMAP (sometimes you would have to choose "other", or "mail client", etc.)
        </p>
        <h2>Specify Account Details</h2>
        <p>
            You will have to fill in the account details. Most likely they will come in a few
            groups, general account information, incoming server (IMAP) details, and outgoing
            server (SMTP) details. Lets go over them.
        </p>
       <h3>General Account Information</h3>
       <p>
           Here, you would need to specify a few things:
            <ul>
                <li>Email address - this is your identifier with "@ubikom.cc" added to it.
                    If your identifier is "bob", your email address is "bob@ubikom.cc".
                </li>
                <li>Account name - this is just a name for your account. Something like 
                    "Ubikom Mail" would do.
                </li>
                <li>Password - the client may use this password for IMAP (and possibly SMTP) login.</li>
                <li>Account type - if you can chose between POP and IMAP, chose IMAP.</li>
            </ul>
       </p>
       <h3>Incoming Server Information</h3>
       <p>
           Here you specify information for your incoming (IMAP) server:
           <ul>
               <li>Server addres - enter "alpha.ubikom.cc"</li>
               <li>Server port - 993, which is the default.</li>
               <li>User name - this is your user name from the identity details page.</li>
               <li>Password - your password.</li>
               <li>Security - chose SSL/TLS.</li>
               <li>Authentication - choose Plain, or Normal Password.</li>
           </ul>
       </p>
       <h3>Outgoing Server Information</h3>
       <p>
           This section is for outgoing (SMTP) server:
           <ul>
            <li>Server addres - enter "alpha.ubikom.cc"</li>
            <li>Server port - 465, which is the default.</li>
            <li>User name - this is your user name from the identity details page.</li>
            <li>Password - your password.</li>
            <li>Security - chose SSL/TLS.</li>
            <li>Authentication - choose Plain, or Normal Password.</li>
            <li>If you have a checkbox saying something like 
                "server requires authentication", make sure it's checked</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
