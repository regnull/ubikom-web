        <h1>Ubikom: Secure and Private Email, Based on Self-Sovereign Identity</h1>
        <p><a href="mailto:lgx@ubikom.cc">lgx@ubikom.cc</a></p>
        <h2>Universe, Identity and Everything</h2>
        <p>Anything in the universe can be modelled as objects exchanging messages. 
            This includes rocks, cars, people, elementary particles
            and even you.</p>
        <p>So let's assume you are one of these objects and you receive a bunch of messages.
            At some point, you might be interested in finding out who exactly is sending those messages.</p>
        <p>One way to do it is to assign every object a unique name, and identify every sender by name.
            There are three tricky parts here:
            <ul>
                <li>How to guarantee name uniqueness?</li>
                <li>How to guarantee message delivery to the correct recipient?</li>
                <li>How to guarantee that the message was not tampered with in transit?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>One possible answer here is to have a central authority tasked with assigning globally unique names
            to objects and message delivery between objects. The problem with this approach is that everything
            is dependent on the existence and goodwill of such central authority. This is not the approach we
            want to take.
        </p>
        <p>Another way to address this is to have a unique private/public key pair assigned to each object. 
            Now every message sent out can be signed using the private key and verified using the public key.
        </p>
        <p>Now, the object identity is reduced to private key control.</p>
        <p>If you are signing all the outgoing messages with your private key, you might as well 
            encrypt them with a unique key derived from your private key and the recipient's public key.
            This way, only the recipient can decrypt the message.
        </p>
        <p>With this encryption in place, the question of how exactly messages get delivered becomes much
            less important. Since only the recipient can read the message, we might as well just dump all
            the messages into one giant data pile and let the recipients pick out their messages.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, addressing objects by their public keys works well for machines but not so well for humans.
            We prefer short friendly names, so we might want to create a registry to record such names and 
            which keys do they correspond to. But we must make sure that such a registry does not become
            the central authority that we are so eager to avoid.
        </p>
        <p>The identity registry can also serve other purposes, for example, making message delivery easier
            by specifying service for each object. It can 
            also be used to delegate certain functions from one key to another, and to disable keys that 
            are compromised.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Ubikom is based on the following design goals:
            <ul>
            <li>User identity must be controlled by the user - the concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity.</a></li>
            <li>Communications must be private and secure by default. In the Ubikom ecosystem, there is no way to send a message without signing and encrypting it.</li>
            <li>Core software must be open-source</li>
            <li>There is no central authority controlling the Ubikom ecosystem. Eventually, the identity registry will be decentralized and distributed</li>
            <li>Getting your identity must be free, so anyone (and anything) can get it easily</li>
            <li>Sending and receiving messages must be absolutely trivial</li>
            <li>Users must have freedom to decide how to compromise between security and convenience. Users might decide to delegate their authority to a third-party system, a decision that can be revoked at any time</li>
            <li>The system must be resilient to prevent spam and abuse.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="diag/deploy.png" width="670" height="518" />
        </p>
        <p>
            The system components include:
            <ul>
                <li>Identity Server, responsible for registering and querying user identity.</li>
                <li>Dump Server, responsible for storing encrypted messages.</li>
                <li>Email Proxy, responsible for encrypting and decrypting messages and supporting calls from the clients
                    via POP3 and SMTP protocols.
                </li>
                <li>Gateway server, responsible for interfacing with the legacy email system.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The identity server is the most important component. It is currently centralized, but will be eventually 
            distributed. It can be used on its own to support this and many other use cases. 
            The rest of the components are there to implement the full working email backend. 
        </p>
        <h2>Identity Service</h2>
        <p>Identity service is responsible for registering keys, names, and addresses. The information is stored 
            in the identity registry, which will eventually be decentralized.
        </p>
        <p>The identity service exposes two interfaces: identity registration and identity lookup:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="diag/identity.png" width="410" height="358"/>
        </p>
        <p>In order to locate other users public key, we use the identity registry. The registry is a key-value store, which 
            contains the following entities:
            <ul>
                <li>Public keys and related data (a public key may be disabled, for example)</li>
                <li>Names. Each name is associated with a public key.</li>
                <li>Addresses. Each address is indexed by name and protocol, and basically means "if you want to communicate with me 
                    using this protocol, this is where you can find me".
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>It is absolutely essential that the identity registry is decentralized and distributed, without any central authority 
            controlling it. The decentralization will be achieved step by step:
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Single node identity registry</li>
                <li>Step 2: Single node identity registry publishing verifiable database snapshots.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Distributed identity registry with fixed number of nodes.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Distributed identity registry with dynamic nodes.</li>
            </ul>
            Currently, we have a single node identity registry which is about to start publishing database snapshots (Step 2).
        </p>
        <h2>Dump Server</h2>
        <p>Dump server stores encrypted messages temporarily, allowing recipients to pick up their messages as needed.</p>
        <p>It has only two methods - to send and receive a message. Anyone can send a message, but only the owner of the private key
        can receive messages addressed to it.</p>
        <p2>It's up to the user to decide how to receive their messages. The identity registry contains a record specifying the endpoint
            where a dump server (or another server implementing same interface) is located.
        </p2>
        <h2>Email Proxy</h2>
        <p>To make everything working end-to-end without coding new email clients, we want to take advantage of the existing
            clients. A translation layer is required to convert gRPC calls (used between Ubikom components) to SMTP/POP3 calls
            used by email clients. The encryption and decryption is handled on the fly by the email proxy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ideally, each user would run email proxy on their machine, to keep control over their private keys. This requirement, 
            however, would limit the adoption, and would not answer the question of how to handle potential web clients. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If we were to run public email proxy, we would need a way to transmit user credentials to the proxy, without risk
            of losing control of the user's private key. To do that, we use concept of limited authority delegation to the email
            proxy while keeping the ultimate authority over user's private key.
        </p>
        <h2>Delegating Authority</h2>
        <p>
            When a private key is created and registered, it is required to perform any action associated with this key, which include:
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypting and decryption messages</li>
                <li>Registering names</li>
                <li>Registering addresses</li>
                <li>Registering key relationship</li>
                <li>Disabling the key</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Email proxy only needs encryption and decryption. If we were to send user's private key to the public proxy,
            we would risk the key being compromised, allowing all the operations listed above.
        </p>
        <p>
            To handle this situation, we introduce another key, which is registered as a child of the main key. Child keys are only
            allowed to perform encryption and decryption, but none of other operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Child key is transmitted to the email proxy in a secure way, and then used to encrypt outgoing messages and decrypt 
            incoming messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the child key is compromised, the user would use the main key to generate another email key, disable the previous one,
            and transfer name and address registration to the new key.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, it might be a good idea to do email key rotation on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <h2>Distributed Identity Registry</h2>
        <h3>Single Node Operation</h3>
        <p>Let's consider how distributed identity registry will work. Here's a single registry node:</p>
        <p><img src="diag/registry-node.png" width="502" height="290"/></p>
        <p>Each node has its own copy of the identity registry database, its private key and name (key and name are linked
            via a record in the identity database).
        </p>
        <p>The node talks to other nodes and external users by receiving transaction requests. For each transaction, it
            performs the following processing:
            <ul>
                <li>Check if this transaction was processed before. If so, drop this request.</li>
                <li>Check if this transaction complies with the agreed-upon rules. If not, drop this request.</li>
                <li>Apply the transaction to the database.</li>
                <li>Add the transaction to the transaction log.</li>
                <li>Forward the transaction to peers.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Database Snapshots</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="diag/snapshots.png" width="400" height="460"/>
        </p>
        <p>The identity database uses multiple value versions to be able to tell the value at any given time (or 
            at least for some reasonable time in the past). At predefined moment in time, each node generates a 
            database snapshot (while still processing transactions). For the sake of the argument let's say it does
            it every 24 hours. So at 12:01 am each day, snapshot generator generates a database snapshot representing
            the exact state at that time.
        </p>
        <p>After a snapshot is generated, it computes its hash (H0, H1, H2, etc.) and signs the snapshot with node's 
            private key.
        </p>
        <p>The identity registry snapshots are publicly available, so that users and other nodes can download snapshot
            representing the database state at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The transaction log is also publicly available, so when a node is being bootstrapped, it downloads the 
            latest snapshot from another node and then replays all the transactions that happened since.
        </p>
        <h3>Consensus Between Nodes</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="diag/consensus.png" width="530" height="300" />
        </p>
        <p>After a snapshot is generate and its hash is known, each node sends a message to all other nodes containing
            a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) of this hash. This means that other nodes can either confirm that their snapshot
            has the same hash or not.
        </p>
        <p>This continues for some fixed time (let's say 10 minutes). During this time, each node collects information to
            either confirm that it has the same snapshot as the majority of other nodes, or that it doesn't.
        </p>
        <p>Let's say that our hash is confirmed by most of the other nodes (ideally all of them). When the consensus period
            is expired, each node will write down the signature block containing the hash of the snapshot and ZKP from all
            nodes confirming it. When a snapshot is confirmed by the majority of the nodes, it is considered to be done and
            the nodes proceeds with transaction processing until it's time to generate next snapshot.
        </p>
        <p>In a situation when our snapshot differs from the majority of other nodes, we discard it, download the snapshot
            confirmed by the majority, and replay all transactions following the snapshot. When it's time to generate the next
            snapshot, we proceed as before.
        </p>
        <p>There is also an unlikely scenario when a majority of nodes is unable to agree on the correct hash. This is mostly
            a theoretical possibility, but if it were to happen, the problem can either be resolved by discarding all changes
            since the previous snapshot, or by an operator intervention.
        </p>
        <h3>Signing Nodes vs. Candidate Nodes</h3>
